## The purpose of this project is to code tweets and texts for content pertaining to e-cigarette flavor, and then assess the association between past 28-day flavor texts and survey-reported belief that e-cigarettes taste good.

## The final repo will contain the following scripts and datasets:
//1.	Python coding of content- Scripts (spyder/python): Twitter_ecigtaste_script & Longform_ecigtastewindow_script // Outputs: Twitter_ecigtaste_coded.csv & Longform_ecigtastewindow_coded.csv
//2.	Aggregating content by survey data-	Script: ContentSurveyDataAggregated.md // Outputs:ContentSurveyDataAggregated.csv &	Clustered regression results; Graphs: Content/beliefs over time,	Predicted proportions
